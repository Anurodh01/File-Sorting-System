# File-Sorting-System
File separator application using os and shutil

--> Run this code and enter the file path where you want to sort audio, video and document files.

Three new following folders will be created in that path:
    audioFiles (containing all audio files)
    videoFiles (containing all video files)
    docFiles  (containing all types of doc files)
    
Image files and some other files will remain same in the current folder while audio video and docs will be sorted.
